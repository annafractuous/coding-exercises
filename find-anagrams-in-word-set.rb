# Given a dictionary, find all the sets of anagrams

# input will be an array of strings
# output will be an array of arrays of strings

# first thought is to sort the dictionary by length, so that we can compare words
# of the same length. we can't just pull out words of the same length, because we don't know
# how long the words are
